              <h1> Production: </h2>
              <h2> Production Services: </h2>
              <p> North American Assembly currently runs production for Ford and GM
                including air boxes, switches, dome lamps, tail lamp assemblies and more.
                Specializing in assembly is our strong point.  Although there are many suppliers
                that claim they offer assembly services, and do, as well as their
                core business of molding or stamping, no supplier can match the
                expertise and quality that we can provide.  Many larger companies
                are choosing to outsource assembly operations due to cost
                advantages that come with doing business with a company
                like North American Assembly.  We are also currently aligning
                with a large Asian automotive components supplier to gain the
                cost advantage of lower cost components.
              <h2> Production Equipment </h2>
