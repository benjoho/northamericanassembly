# northamericanassembly
This website is the for a company called North American Assembly. They focus on building high quality parts for large car manufacturers such as GM, Ford, and Chrysler. I built this as a summer intern(Summer 2014) after I noticed their website looked really dated. This was my very first project in web development so I was grateful they gave me free reign. They were really happy with the results as they could customize it as much as they wanted. Their old website was a template which made customization basically impossible. The following summer they had difficulty adding pictures to the photo gallery so I went back and added a iframe for a google drive album which allowed them to add pictures without having to hard code anything.
